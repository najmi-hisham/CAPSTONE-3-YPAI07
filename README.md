# TEXT CLASSIFIFCATION
TEXT CLASSIFIFCATION USING NATURAL LANGUANGE PROCESSING

# INTRODUCTION
In this project, we use E-Commerce dataset to create NLP to creata text classification that can classify text into what category (Books ,Clothing & Accessories ,Electronics ,Household). Dataset has been divided into two column where the first one is category and second is
text. You will see the step by step on creating NLP model to classify text in the main code. The architecture model used for this project is Bidirectional LSTSM model that usually being used in NLP application.

# OBJECTIVE
- To create text classification application in E-commerce
- To implement NLP model using Bidirection LSTM model
- To achieve high accuracy during training without overfitting
